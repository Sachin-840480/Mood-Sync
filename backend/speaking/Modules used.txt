We have used these modules in our text to voice generator. 

1. gTTS Module.
    command :- "pip install gTTS" 

    This Module uses internet to create the Voice generator.

2. playsound Module.
    command :- "pip install playsound"

    The installation of this module, creates multiple problems, so try to install it from the Anaconda Prompt, it was able to get it to install. 

    Other Thing that can be done is, we can install the older version of the same module.
        command :- "pip uninstall playsound"  (To first uninstall it.)
                   "pip install playsound == 1.2.2"       (then install the older version.)

 
3. pyttsx3 Mdoule.
    command :- "pip install pyttsx3"

    This Module is for the offline use of the Voice generator.

4. sys Module.
    
    This Module is used for getting Command Line arguments, which in this case is the language code for the translation process.
